Title: SafeRouteAI: Smart Travel Planner and Safety
 
ABSTRACT

The Safe Route AI Travel Assistant is a web-based application developed to help
travelers plan safe and personalized trips within Kerala. It utilizes artificial
intelligence and machine learning to detect safety risks and provide smart destination
suggestions based on user preferences like budget and interests. This system is helpful
for tourists, local travelers, and trip planners who want support in choosing safe and
smart travel options. The system is built using HTML and CSS for the frontend,
Python with Flask for the backend, and stores data in SQLite or CSV files. The system
features a rule-based chatbot that interacts with users through predefined questions
and responses to collect inputs, receive filtered destination options based on safety
levels, and view recommended travel plans tailored to their needs. For safety
evaluation, the system uses a Random Forest classification algorithm, a supervised
ML technique well-suited for multi-feature classification problems. It analyzes recent
weather updates, historical disasters, and health-related concerns, helping the system
avoid unsafe routes. Users can mark favourite destinations and receive personalized suggestions based on their previous travel history. These features provide more relevant recommendations and enhance the overall travel planning experience. By integrating AI, ML, and chatbot technology, the offers a practical, safety-aware travel planner that supports informed and confident decision-making for modern travelers.
